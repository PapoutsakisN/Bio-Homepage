            <h3>A Luffy "Quickie"</h3>
            <p>Monkey D. Luffy, also known as "Straw Hat Luffy" and commonly as "Straw Hat", is the founder and captain
                of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates, as well as one of its top three fighters.
                His lifelong dream is to become the Pirate King by finding the legendary treasure left behind by the
                late Gol D. Roger. He believes that being Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world.</p>
            <h3 style="padding-top: 15%;">Appearance</h3>
            <p>Luffy has black shaggy hair, round black eyes, and a slim muscular build. He is renowned for his
                trademark straw hat (from which he gets his nickname "Straw Hat Luffy"), which was lent to him when he
                was young by the legendary pirate captain, "Red-Haired" Shanks, who in turn received it from Gol D.
                Roger. He wears short, blue trousers with cuffs, sandals, and a sleeveless red vest. Luffy also has a
                scar with two stitches underneath his left eye (which he earned by stabbing a knife under his eye to
                show Shanks that he was tough and not afraid of pain) and short, messy black hair. He was severely
                wounded by Akainu in the Battle of Marineford, leaving a large X-shaped scar on his chest.</p>
            <h3 style="padding-top: 15%;">Personality</h3>
            <p>Luffy's personality is like that of a child's, in the sense that he tends to go to the extremes. He can
                either be extremely greedy, especially in cases of food, who his crew is, and adventure, or
                extraordinarily selfless, going so far as to virtually sacrifice himself to avenge or protect his
                friends, crew, and family. This childish mentality of his allows him to get to the root of the problem,
                and allows him to figure out the most simple way of solving it. </p>

            <h3 style="padding-top: 15%;">Biorgraphy</h3>
            <p>D. "Straw Hat" Luffy is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the One Piece manga
                series, created by Eiichiro Oda. Luffy made his debut in One Piece Chapter #1 as a young boy who
                acquires the properties of rubber after accidentally eating the supernatural Gum-Gum Fruit.

                Born on May 5, Luffy dreamed of being a pirate since childhood. At the age of 17, Luffy sets sails from
                the East Blue Sea to the Grand Line in search of the legendary treasure, One Piece, to succeed Gol D.
                Roger as King of the Pirates. Luffy, captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, recruits crew members, fights
                antagonists, and aids and befriends the inhabitants of several islands on his journey. Usually cheerful,
                he becomes serious when he fights. Luffy uses his elasticity to concentrate his power, executing a range
                of attacks. In his signature attack, Gum-Gum Pistol, he slingshots punches at opponents from a distance.
                Luffy also grows stronger over the course of the story, as reflected in his "Bounty" which is used to
                measure the threat he poses to the World Government. He is the grandson of Monkey D. Garp and son of
                Monkey D. Dragon, but was raised by Curly Dadan, his foster mother, meeting Portgas D. Ace and Sabo, his
                adopted brothers, in their childhood.</p>
